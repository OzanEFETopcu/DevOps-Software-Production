# Project Team 10

## Server
Server Name: 22wsp_3004_project_team_10
Server Address: 172.16.4.101

## Team
Team Members: Anish Natu, Ozan Topcu

## Access to final prodcution
Frontend: http://172.16.4.101:8080/
Backend: http://172.16.4.101:4040/

## Instructions to run locally
The application can be run by using the "docker-compose up -d" command inside the repository. After running the code user needs to get in "http://localhost:3001" and "http://localhost:5000" to access frontend and backend respectively.

P.S. The internal port is 3001 instead of 3000 since we had personal projects running on port 3000 already.

## Completed Phases
Completed Phase 4. 

## Expected Grade and The Reason Why
We expect 5 since we fulfill every phase requirement with excellent teamwork which was one of the main skills instilled in us throughout the course.
